          <h4>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Spyonclear</span> - is a creator of Sviger, Cluster, OS Mockups Wiki. Have Youtube, Deviantart, FANDOM, and Discord accounts. Owner and bureaucrat of this wiki. Owner of the several Discord servers, but most-known for his eSpyzem server. Made over an thousand edits on this wiki. Had minderian past, but he now regretting about it.
          </h4>
          <h1>History</h1>
          <h2>2015</h2>
          <p>Contrary to popular belief caused by Spyonclear's inactivity on Discord and Spyonclear not used any Youtube accounts before, Spyonclear was aware of Windows Never Released community.</p>
          <p>his old text-based Windows Never Released 1 was reported to be made on March 3, 2015 on Igromaniy wiki, on which it was not minderian, comparing to Windows Never Released 5. WNR1 to WNR4 was inspired by Neptune98, as he watched his videos. It looks like Spyonclear tried to emulate Neptune98's ideas.</p>
          <p>Some ideas on there was planned to be used on the 2020 OS Mockups release.</p>
          <h2>2016-17</h2>
          <p>Spyonclear's text-based Windows Never Released 5 to 16 was inspired by the minderian users, especially Aarex for changing Windows branding names. That happens that WNR5 and WNR6 was a part of Season 1, and WNR7 to WNR16 are the Season 2. Season 2 was nade in a period of October 18 to November 25. The rest of this year had with Season 3, as Spyonclear was fast enough to make Windows Never Released 19.</p>
          <p>QNw name was used on there. This name would be used for the presence of discord up to 2019.</p>
          <p>Core functionality of Season 2 and Season 3 would be used for WNRSEC</p>
          <p>Spyonclear continued to make Season 3 and made Season 4, on which he called one of episodes as Windows Never Released 29.51. Due to him was being a Windows fan, he also made WNR31.1 and WNR 35.1. Spyonclear stopped making text-based WNR series presumeably on August 11, 2017. Althought he listed Windows Never Released 36, it's not shown on his 2019 video.</p>
          <p>Speaking on which, he revealed his old text-based Windows Never Released versions, which makes an idea that Spyonclear didn't forgetting his past journey. His video is called Windows Never Released before Windows Never Released</p>
          <h2>2018</h2>
          <h4>Before WNR on YouTube</h4>
          <p>Spyonclear made an Youtube account in January 27, 2018, using his own real name. After this, in January 30, 2018 he starts <span style="font-style: italic;">Альтернативное Будущее Европы + С. А</span>, which was the fictional future of Europe and North America. Back before his WNR, Spyonclear uploads a few video about Windows.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h4>The ecosystem creation</h4>
          <p>He made his first WNR video in March 29, but it was criticized by having Kinemaster watermark. However, it was the first time he would be known on the bigger YouTube's part of WNR community</p>
          <p>Spyonclear ends the fictional future of Europe and North America series in April 2.</p>
          <p>He creates <span style="font-weight: 700;">WNRSEC</span> in April 19 as version 6.0, which makes Arsenii Ivanov make his WNR under it's rule. Spyonclear starts develop WNRSEC version 6.1 in June 2, with alpha was done in June 3-7, beta in June 8-10, late versions in June 10-15. It was revealed after late beta, which it was on preview in June 15-17. He uploads version 6.1 as a separate document with a name Jemerium (that was codename until June 8) in June 18. Version 6.2 was also in alpha and beta stages, and released in August 2, before it was privated in 3 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">ROSMC</span> was created in July 10, 2018 by him, and intended for Russians, later a little active.
          </p>

          <p>He was involved in Tartarian-Arsenian War at the Arsenii side in August-September, and was an writer on "Новая студия участника overusing dramas" document back in October.</p>
          <h4>After Tartarian-Arsenian War</h4>
          <p>WNRSEC Version 6.3 was another version that was under alpha and beta stages yet again, soon to be released in&nbsp;October 17. After the release, it was under active development. Dima Dino became&nbsp;an WNRSEC editor back since November 9, 2018. Last version of it is 6.3.13.5 after 2 months.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-style: italic;">СД Сервер</span> was an second server that Spyonclear made on October 21.
          </p>
          <p>Spyonclear began work on <a class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1" href="Sviger.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

            </a> in December 20, which actually seen when he created every image and file there.
          </p>
          <h2>2019</h2>
          <p>In 2019 Spyonclear continued to make videos on Youtube. While the initial priority was keeping WNRSEC up to date, and creating non-Windows-based NROS, after Bootleg Incident, he changed his priorities and policy, becoming pro-traditional.&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>Last year to be minderian</h4>
          <p>In January 12, 2019, Spyonclear releases WNRSEC Version 6.4. Dima Dino was an editor for this version in the morning of January 19. They both was still the only developers on this version of WNRSEC.</p>
          <p>Spyonclear was on Mediawiki's OSMWiki on January 24, and after some dramas Spyonclear and Fjattar was involved to, they we're banned on the next day.</p>
          <p>In same day as Spyonclear joins OSMWiki, he finally done Sviger Kit (which he planned to name it Sviger Pack) and uploads it to DeviantArt, and after that&nbsp;Arsenii&nbsp;actively used Sviger and it's .zip file for his Sviger Never Released series, which runs to this day. For some moments later, Arsen creates Sviger Wiki, and promotes Spyonclear as an admin.</p>
          <p>Spyonclear creates <a class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2" href="https://osm.fandom.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
              <span style="font-weight: 700;">OS Mockups Wiki</span>

          </p>
          <p>Following in February 2019, in a&nbsp;Bootleg Incident, relations between Spyonclear and Fjattar became worse, causing to both to build their own antics, like name reveal, and other things.</p>
          <p>Spyonclear would release Windows Never Released 2 video on YouTube</p>
          <h4>Spyonclear: Become Normal</h4>

It is alternatively called Windows Never Released base for Paint.net beginers, so DeviantArt users would know that this kit is related to the WNR. Since then, Spyonclear will use that kit alongside with OSMK for his WNR. He's actively fighted for deminderisation of WNR Community at that time.

The content, however, turned out to be forgotten due to OS Mockups are released without Windows 4k, Windows 8k and Windows Prague.</p>
          <p>Lately, storage channel Spyonclear uploaded OS Mockups Collab intro, and two&nbsp;spyonintros.</p>

          <p>On February, Spyonclear's video Windows Never Released Classic got stolen, it's modified at low quality, and uploaded under the <span style="font-style: italic;">spyoncomb</span> name by Fjattar. When that video get copied back to Spyonclear channel, it got copyright claimed.
          </p>
          <p>On the same February, Spyonclear worked on <span style="font-weight: 700;">Hardware Mockups Wiki</span>, which is an wikia about fictional hardware, and it followed the same logic as OS Mockups Wiki. Hardware Mockups Wiki gained it's own background, and the transparency.
          </p>
