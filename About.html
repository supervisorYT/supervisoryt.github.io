WNR1 to WNR4 was inspired by Neptune98, as he watched his videos. It looks like Spyonclear tried to emulate Neptune98's ideas.<br>Some ideas on there was intended to be used on the 2020 OS Mockups releases.

That happens that WNR5 and WNR6 was a part of Season 1, and WNR7 to WNR16 are the Season 2. Season 2 was nade in a period of October 18 to November 25. The rest of this year had with Season 3, as Spyonclear was fast enough to make Windows Never Released 19.<br>QNw name was used on there. This name would be used for the presence of discord up to 2019.<br>Core functionality of Season 2 and Season 3 would be used for WNRSEC.<br>Spyonclear continued to make Season 3 and made Season 4, on which he called one of episodes as Windows Never Released 29.51. Due to him was being a Windows fan, he also made WNR31.1 and WNR 35.1. Spyonclear stopped making text-based WNR series presumeably on August 11, 2017. Althought he listed Windows Never Released 36, it's not shown on his 2019 video.<br>Speaking on which, he revealed his old text-based Windows Never Released versions, which makes an idea that Spyonclear didn't forgetting his past journey. His video is called Windows Never Released before Windows Never Released
